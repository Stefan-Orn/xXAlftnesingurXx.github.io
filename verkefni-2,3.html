  <p class="Texti1"> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
    printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
    not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
    unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
    Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
    versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
